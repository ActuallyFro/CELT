CLI Environment Launcher for TMUX (CELT)
========================================

TL;DR: It launches tmux with default windows

About
-----
This tool was created due to laziness.
It simply has preconfigurations to launch a CLI/devloper environment.

History
-------
I made this once to help with tmux shared sessions, and now I'm repurposing the script.
